When I got home I played some minecraft with Matthew and Eric and then talked to them on my drive downtown.

Went downtown for Evan's birthday. They had a cake and gave me an empty plate with a fork as a joke and I did not appreciate it.

Got some reassurance that I am not balding.

The drive back was brutal past 2 am I do not seem to drive well at night.
