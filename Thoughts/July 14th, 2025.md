Nick Usenko is gay???

Didn't know this. I've liked him for quite a while now. Gonna see what happens.

It's good because like, this is a guy who is my type and is just someone who is super nice and good. At the same time this is a coworker. I can't overstep.

I just want to know.

This is not the be all end all though. There will be other guys out there for me, and if nothing happens, I get a new gay friend out of this!
