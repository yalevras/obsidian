For all linear systems, the net response caused by two or more stimuli is the sum of the individual responses of each stimulus.
$$F(x_1+x_2) = F(x_1) + F(x_2)$$
$$F(ax)=aF(x)$$
A Function *F(x)* satisfying the superposition principle is called a linear function. Superposition is defined by the above, additivity and homogeneity, for scalar *a*.
