- lets only 1 obc receive commands at a time
- we want to remove this

2 ways to receive, umbilical or read up link

- when we receive data, we need to have more error checking. make sure we are receiving a command not a telemetry packet
- in spacewire packet, make sure path check validity of wha we are receiving

So basically whats happening is we can get rid of the uplink control as the obc it is designated for is going to be either sent by wifi for hkobc or umbilical for pobc, the issue arises when you want to go through the dtn radio, but for that Romanâ€™s ipn address node for each obc will go to that first and then it will get sent to the obcs so we do not need to worry about extra redundancy we do not need
