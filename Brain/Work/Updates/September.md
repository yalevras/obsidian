helped ishan with some debugging
my ci_lab stuff is NOT the issue with my asp script stuff there is something wrong with my compression parameters, i probably don't need to finalize this yet because the edu is not going to be ready to run msi stuff for a bit
to do:
- charge rover and pack it up tomorrow
	- checklist:
		- rover (strap to car)
		- black box
		- glass panel installation
		- MOXA route
		- 49->56
		- charge rover
		- mouse
		- keyboard
		- NUC power cable
- rover pause (probably do this wednesday once misst is more open and mitchell is in stratford)
- msi compression script, msi download script
- nsp unit tests
