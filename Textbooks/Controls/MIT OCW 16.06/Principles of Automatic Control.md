**1. Why automatic control? Categorization of control systems**
Manual and automatic control. Focus on automatic control.
Automatic can hold output steady signal.
	Regulator: keep output at a steady, known value
	Tracking or servo system: Make output track a reference system.

Open-loop:
Closed-loop: Controllers (or feedback controllers) compute the control action based on the measured output of the system being controlled.

**2. Block diagrams, the effect of feedback**
Automatic control benefits:
- reduces workload
- performs tasks people can't
- reduces the effects of disturbances
- reduces the effects of plant variations
- stabilizes an unstable system
- improves the performance of a system (time response)
- improve the linearity of the system
